"""
Pros 
1. Function being stateless do not depend on external states , making reuse easy. Each call operates independently 
Cons 
1. Managing the states become cumbersome because we need to pass the collection explicity each time and return the updated 
collection
2. Functional programming : emphasis is on immutablity 
"""
"""
OOP address 
1. Pros 
Encapsulation allows management of state within the object, Methods belong to the class , so we do not need to pass the 
collection explicitly / each time. Extension and management is modularized in code 
2. Cons 
More complex than functional programming for simple tasks.  Requires more setup with class definations and instances
